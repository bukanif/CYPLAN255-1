    "As we saw, Python's core library doesn't have that many functions. In order to use functions that people have written before, but are not included in core Python, we need to load a library. In Python, this is done via the `import` command.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can of course give them different names of your choice, e.g., `import numpy as bunny`, but that is bad coding practice (it is confusing to the readers) and is strongly discouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to import everything (for example, if you want to use just one function from a huge library), do `from ... import ...` and then you can access the function directly, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from numpy import array\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you can then use `array()` directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some libraries (python calls them modules) have submodules. For example, `scipy` has a submodule `scipy.optimize`. You can either `import scipy.optimize` or `from scipy import optimize`.\n",

    "**When you import a module, its submodules are not always automatically imported! If you do `import scipy`, for example, its submodule `scipy.optimize` is NOT imported. You have to explicitly import the submodule as well.** There are some exceptions, however, e.g., `os` submodules are imported with the module.\n",

This is where you put in an address (or some other sort of query keywords) and get the spatial coordinates. You do this on a daily basis when you type an address in Google Maps and find the latitude and longitude of that place. As we will learn more about API requests in the future, we do not require that you do this programmatically, but you are welcome to do that if you like challenges.\n",
